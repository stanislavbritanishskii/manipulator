I decided to first create a small prototype running only on 9g servos, reused some 3d models from the dog, found a gripper online, designed a few simple connectors and used some tape to connect other pieces. instead of soldering all as i usually do ran it via bread board. Surprisingly I managed to assemble the full hand in just 4-5 hours from scratch. for power I'm using that 5V 30A terrifying converter I used before for different tests. the esp is running pretty well via wifi and udp, haven't had any issues so far. the hand I got is operational I can even move stuff around, for now, obviously via manual controls, but that is still kinda a lot for a single day. so far so good.
