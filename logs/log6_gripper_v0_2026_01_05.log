Day before yesterday I made the first version of the gripper, as of now I'm unhappy with it. it runs with gears at ratio 2:1 to servo, the gripping hands are straight and they don't even align that well. I will be remaking it completely, I'm thinking about making gripper work with two servos each of them directly manipulating one finger, hopefully this will give me a better result
