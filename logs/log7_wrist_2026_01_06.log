I would imagine the first version of the wrist is ready, it is can grasp with fingers rotate them and also angle them. Just now I started a pring of lower arm, that is not the full piece but should be enough for initial testing, will print a second part for more stability.
Figured out today that I will need better cables and cable connectors, soldering all together is not the best idea for repairability, development or anything, they will be arriving in a week or so, found out that aliexpress is noticeably cheaper than amazon, especially when ordering lots of small items.
the results are looking good so far, but there still is a long wayp to go even with the hardware, the software is going to be headbraking probably.
